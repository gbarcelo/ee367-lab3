## Compiling and Running
There is a makefile you can browse, but here are the most important commands:
- `make`  compiles from /src/ to /bin/ without running the output programs
- `make server` compiles and runs the server program
- `make client` compiles and runs client367
- `make clean` removes all files in /bin/ and .txt files in /client/

You can manually run the compiled programs (if you wanted to input your own arguments)--they are located in the bin.
